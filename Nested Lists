Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

    arr1=[]
    arr2=[]
    arr3=[]
    arr4=[]
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        arr1.append(score)
        arr2.append([name, score])
    list1 = list(set((arr1)))
    list1.sort()
    lowest2 = list1[1]
    
    for name, score in arr2:
        if score == lowest2:
            arr3.append(name)
    arr3.sort()
    # x = min(arr1)
    # idx = arr1.index(x)
